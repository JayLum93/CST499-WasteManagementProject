-------------------------------------------------

For the Trash/Recycle/Compost Items, adding additional sprites is fairly easy.
Make sure the item you are adding is a .png file for transperancy reasons.
Proceed to add your Transparent .png sprite into the "Sprites" Folder within Unity.
Once added, refer to the Inspector Tab and alter the following; Filter Mode: Bilinear, Max Size: 2048, Format: Compressed
You can then drag and drop the sprite within the Scene Tab and tweak it as much as you like.

For the code to work, please Tag your newly added item accordingly.
There are already Specific Tags you can use which are TrashTag, RecycleTag, and CompostTag.
You can always refer to the Prefabs Folder to look up existing sprites in the game and copying the neccessary tweaks
already implemented.
